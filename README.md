- 👋 Hi, I’m Sebastien,
- 🌏 I'm Australian, and have been coding for 1 month.
- 👀 I’m interested in cars, engineering and coding as well as spending time in nature.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to code, my current language is Python but I would like to get into JS eventually.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on smaller projects with less people.
- 💻 I code because I enjoy the process of creating something.
